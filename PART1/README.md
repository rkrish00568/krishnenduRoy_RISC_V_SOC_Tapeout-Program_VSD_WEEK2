## ðŸ”¹ What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an **integrated circuit** that combines all essential components of a computer system into a **single chip**.  
Instead of using multiple separate chips for processing, memory, and peripherals, SoC brings them together in one package.

SoCs are designed for **compactness, energy efficiency, and high performance**, making them ideal for smartphones, wearables, IoT devices, and embedded systems.

## ðŸ”¹ Components of a Typical SoC

1.  **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
    
    -   Acts as the brain of the SoC.
        
    -   Executes instructions, performs calculations, and manages system operations.
        
2.  **Memory**
    
    -   **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Stores temporary data and active processes.
        
    -   **ROM/Flash:** Stores permanent data, firmware, and system software.
        
3.  **I/O Interfaces**
    
    -   Provide connectivity to external devices (USB, HDMI, camera, audio, sensors, etc.).
        
    -   Allow the SoC to interact with the outside world.
        
4.  **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**
    
    -   Handles image rendering, gaming, and visual processing.
        
    -   Essential for smartphones, tablets, and multimedia systems.
        
5.  **DSP (Digital Signal Processor)**
    
    -   Specialized for processing audio and video signals.
        
    -   Used in tasks like voice recognition, image filtering, and noise reduction.
        
6.  **Interconnect / Bus System**
    
    -   Internal communication fabric that connects CPU, memory, peripherals, and other blocks.
        
    -   Examples: AMBA (AXI, AHB), NoC (Network-on-Chip).
        
7.  **Power Management Unit (PMU)**
    
    -   Optimizes power consumption across different modules.
        
    -   Extends battery life in portable devices.
        
8.  **Special Features (Optional)**
    
    -   Wireless communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE/5G).
        
    -   Security modules (encryption engines, secure boot).
        
    -   Application-specific accelerators (AI, ML, camera ISP).
